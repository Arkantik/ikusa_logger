## 📥 Installation

### Method 1: Installer (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to install BDO Combat Logger. The installer handles everything automatically.

---

#### ⚠️ Windows Security Warning

When downloading and running `bdo-combat-installer.exe` for the first time, Windows Defender SmartScreen will display a security warning:

```
"Windows protected your PC - Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting"
```

#### ✅ This is Normal and Expected

This warning appears because the application is not code-signed with an expensive certificate ($300-500/year). **The application is completely safe** - all source code is publicly available on GitHub for review.

#### How to Run the Application

Follow these steps when you see the warning:

1. Click **"More info"** on the SmartScreen warning
2. Click **"Run anyway"** button that appears
3. The application will start normally

#### Why Does This Warning Appear?

* Code signing certificates cost $300-500 per year from Certificate Authorities
* As a free, open-source project, we don't have commercial funding for certificates
* Windows shows this warning for any unsigned application, regardless of safety
* Thousands of apps on GitHub have the same situation - it's standard for open-source software

#### What Does This Application Actually Do?

The BDO Combat Logger:

* ✅ **Only reads** network traffic (like Wireshark does)
* ✅ Does **NOT** modify game files
* ✅ Does **NOT** inject code into games
* ✅ Does **NOT** access sensitive data
* ✅ **All source code** is public and can be audited on GitHub

---

1. **Right-click** the installer and select **"Run as administrator"**
2. If you see the Windows SmartScreen warning, follow the steps above to proceed
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. The installer will automatically:
   - ✅ Install the BDO Combat Logger application
   - ✅ Install Npcap driver (if not already installed)

2. Upload your `.log` file
3. View detailed statistics, graphs, and analysis of your combat performance

The website provides:

- Kill/Death ratios
- Performance over time
- Player and guild statistics
- Interactive charts and graphs

## ❗ Troubleshooting

<details>

### Startup Issues

**Problem**: Logger won't start or shows errors immediately

**Solutions**:

1. Check if Npcap is properly installed:
   - Open the logger
   - Check the status message on the home screen
   - If it says "Npcap is not installed", download and install from [npcap.com](https://npcap.com/dist/)
   - Or reinstall using the full installer

### "The system cannot find the path specified" Error

This error usually means Python is not added to your system PATH (only relevant for manual builds):

1. Follow this guide to add Python to PATH: [Python PATH Configuration Guide](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/)
2. After adding Python to PATH, restart your computer
3. Try building again

### No Logs Being Captured

1. **VPN or Software altering your network**: If you are using a VPN or any Software that alters your normal network, it will prevent the tool to pick up events during your record session.

2. **Config is outdated**: BDO changes its network structure after each weekly maintenance

   - Wait for a config update
   - Check the Discord for announcements
   - As a backup, use Wireshark to record the session, then analyze the `.pcap` file later

3. **Wrong network interface selected**:

   - Go to Settings
   - Try switching between "All" and "Default" network interfaces
   - Restart recording

4. **Firewall or antivirus blocking**:
   - Add an exception for the logger in your antivirus
   - Run the logger as Administrator

### Logs Have Wrong Names

1. In the log display, use the dropdown menus to reorder the names
2. The correct format is: **YourGuild-FamilyName killed/died to Enemy-FamilyName from Guild**
3. Save the corrected logs

### Can't Save Logs / Logs Not Found

1. Make sure you've adjusted the names correctly
2. Check that you have write permissions in the save location
3. Try saving to a different folder (like Documents)

## 🤔 FAQ

<details>

**Q: Is this tool safe to use?**  
A: Yes, the logger only reads network packets and doesn't modify or inject anything into the game.

**Q: Will I get banned for using this?**  
A: The tool operates similarly to Wireshark and only observes network traffic. However, use at your own discretion.

**Q: Why is the config outdated after maintenance?**  
A: BDO changes its network packet structure during weekly maintenance. The config needs to be updated to match these changes. Check Discord for updates.

**Q: Can I use this during any PvP activity?**  
A: Yes! It works during Node Wars, Sieges and GvG.

**Q: Can I edit logs after saving them?**  
A: Yes! Use the Open function to load your `.log` file, adjust the names, and save again.

**Q: What if I accidentally close the logger while recording?**  
A: A warning message should appear asking you to confirm. If you lose data, you can use your Wireshark recording as backup (if you made one).

**Q: Do I need to install Python and Node.js if I use the installer?**  
A: No! The installer method is completely standalone. You only need Python and Node.js if you're building from source manually.

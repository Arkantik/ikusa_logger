## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

### Startup Issues

**Problem**: Logger won't start or shows errors immediately

**Solutions**:

1. Check if Npcap is properly installed:
   - Open the logger
   - Check the status message on the home screen
   - If it says "Npcap is not installed", download and install from [npcap.com](https://npcap.com/dist/)

### "The system cannot find the path specified" Error

This error usually means Python is not added to your system PATH:

1. Follow this guide to add Python to PATH: [Python PATH Configuration Guide](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/)
2. After adding Python to PATH, restart your computer
3. Try building again

### No Logs Being Captured

**Possible causes and solutions**:

1. **Config is outdated**: BDO changes its network structure after each weekly maintenance

   - Wait for a config update
   - Check the Discord for announcements
   - As a backup, use Wireshark to record the session, then analyze the `.pcap` file later

2. **Wrong network interface selected**:

   - Go to Settings
   - Try switching between "All" and "Default" network interfaces
   - Restart recording

3. **Firewall or antivirus blocking**:
   - Add an exception for the logger in your antivirus
   - Run the logger as Administrator

### Logs Have Wrong Names

1. Stop recording
2. In the log display, use the dropdown menus to reorder the names
3. The correct format is: **Player1 killed/died to Player2 from Guild**
4. Save the corrected logs

### Can't Save Logs / Logs Not Found

1. Make sure you've adjusted the names correctly
2. Check that you have write permissions in the save location
3. Try saving to a different folder (like Documents)

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Is this tool safe to use?**  
A: Yes, the logger only reads network packets and doesn't modify or inject anything into the game.

**Q: Will I get banned for using this?**  
A: The tool operates similarly to Wireshark and only observes network traffic. However, use at your own discretion.

**Q: Why is the config outdated after maintenance?**  
A: BDO changes its network packet structure during weekly maintenance. The config needs to be updated to match these changes. Check Discord for updates.

**Q: Can I use this during any PvP activity?**  
A: Yes! It works during Node Wars, Sieges and GvG.

**Q: Can I edit logs after saving them?**  
A: Yes! Use the Open function to load your `.log` file, adjust the names, and save again.

**Q: What if I accidentally close the logger while recording?**  
A: A warning message should appear asking you to confirm. If you lose data, you can use your Wireshark recording as backup (if you made one).
